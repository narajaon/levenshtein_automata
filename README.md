# levenshtein_automata
A project about building an autocompletion and a suggestion module (just like how google does) - Unfinished

## Usage

The original algorithm including a tree with multiple children works but has some leaks issues (history_handler function). Still, the more simple algorithm with strcmp works fine and is rather fast (completion_res).
